# awesome-projects
list of projects that I thought were really cool (also a way for me to get use to github more)

## Matching

Applications of Python 3.10's match function

### List matching

List functions based on OCamel List module (now less type-restricted ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€)

### General Trees
> (requires List_matching.py to function)

Tree functions that take advatange of matching via pattern matching Node class, and matching multiple items at once

## Tiling the Courtyard

Extra credit assignment done for Discrete Structures, make a program that proves the result of the Inductive-proof triomino tiling probem, see https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/inductive-tiling/.

Implements additons to Racket graphics in order to handle displaying courtyards, and divde-and-conquer to solve problem.

## Matrices

A list of functions that I wrote during my time in linear algebra, based on what we were learning.

Handles square matrices only, since a majority of the topics used them.

In addition there is an attempt to make a chemical equation balancer below.

## Math

Other math applications I made

### Ellipse perimeter

Calculates the perimeter of an ellipse via sympy, so only the major/minor axes are required to solve. Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25WgYps1szk

### Calculus II

Three calculus functions based on course content in Calculus 2, via sympy:

- Taylor series approximations

Given a function, iterations, and a center point, returns the taylor series approx. 

- Langrange Error Bound

Finds the error bound for a function, given the same inputs as taylor series, and an x estimate

- Collision Test

Checks whether two system of equations collide with each other, and returns the points at which they do.

### CPU simulator

Old project I made based on Tom Scott's video on how the fetch-cycle process works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI
